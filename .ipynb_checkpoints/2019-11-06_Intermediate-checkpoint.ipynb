    "This workshop is intended to provide some practical examples of Python, with a focus on scientific computing. The purpose is to familiarize you with some useful packages in order to help you learn and use it in your own work. I'll focus on 3 packages: `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `Matplotlib`, with a reference to `Pandas`, which is a way to handle data frames.\n",

    "# NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is one of the first packages I load when working on any project. Python's native `list` and `tuple` classes are useful for many things, but for manipulating data, it's often most useful to work with NumPy `arrays`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical convention is to abbreviate NumPy as `np`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    \n",
    "An array is often made by converting lists or tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    myarray = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "\n",
    "An option within the array to consider is the data type, `dtype`. Options include `int` or `float` as well as numpy data types such as `np.float64` (64 bit float) or `np.uint8` (8 bit unsigned integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays can be multi-dimensional by creating lists of lists or using the `np.reshape()` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    array2d = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]], dtype=np.float64)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Operations on arrays are assumed to be elementwise, but matrix operations are found in the subpackage `np.linalg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Equivalence is a **reference** to an array, rather than a copy. To make a copy, use `.copy()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a = myarray # Both a and myarray point to the same array in memory\n",
    "    a = myarray.copy() # a is a second array initialized to be a copy of myarray"
